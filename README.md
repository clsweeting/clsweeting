## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working with Microsoft, building AI solutions with some of our biggest global customers. 

Led one of the first teams to use agentic AI to solve hard problems. Currently focused on reinforcement learning. 

- [OHDSI WebAPI MCP](https://github.com/clsweeting/ohdsi-webapi-mcp) - MCP server for interacting with OHDSI WebAPI
- [OHDSI WebAPI Python library](https://github.com/clsweeting/ohdsi-webapi-python-client) - pure Python client for OHDSI WebAPI (no R dependencies)
- [OHDSI Cohort Schema](https://github.com/clsweeting/ohdsi-cohort-schemas) - Python implementation of schemas based on [Circe Be](https://github.com/OHDSI/circe-be)
  
Stay curious.
